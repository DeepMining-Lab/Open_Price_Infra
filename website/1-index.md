Open Price is an open-data initiative providing a standardized, continuously updated historical dataset of crypto-asset prices from on-chain sources (e.g., Chainlink, Uniswap V3). Fully compliant with **FAIR** principles, it empowers researchers and developers with transparent, reproducible insights into the price dynamics of various blockchain ecosystems.


üîç **FAIR Compliance**  
**<span class="fair-highlight">Findable</span>:** Clear folder hierarchy, metadata tags in CSV headers  
**<span class="fair-highlight">Accessible</span>:** Public HTTPS endpoints, no authentication required  
**<span class="fair-highlight">Interoperable</span>:** Uniform CSV schema across all blockchains  
**<span class="fair-highlight">Reusable</span>:** Detailed provenance and extraction scripts provided  

üåê **Data Sources & Coverage**  
**Oracles:** Chainlink feeds for major assets  
**DEX Pools:** Uniswap V3 for on-chain liquidity-based pricing  

üí° **Use Cases**  
Backtesting quantitative trading strategies  
Academic research on price formation and volatility  
Building dashboards or analytics tools with up-to-the-minute and historical data  


This project is part of the European initiative  <a href="https://www.faironchain.org" target="_blank">FairOnChain</a>, which aims to provide the public with an open infrastructure that facilitates access to and research on blockchain data.
